## Introduction

Welcome to Algorithmia servie, service for creating and maintaining algorithms. 
Algorithm is designed to help you solve basic mathematical optimisation problems. 

## Features

Algorithmia comes with range of features tailored for:

- **feature 1**: Setting up desired algorithm
- **feature 2**: Validating result
- **feature 3**: Track the routines and activities
- **feature 4**: Manage events
- **feature 5**: Creates and sends reports
- **feature 6**: Register and connect with other services

For a detailed guide on using these features, refer to TODO: [User Manual](docs/user-manual.md).
